# Image Upload Implementation Summary

## Overview
Image upload functionality has been fully implemented for both profile pictures and listing images using AWS S3 cloud storage.

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### Backend (Complete)

#### 1. AWS S3 Integration
- **Package**: `AWSSDK.S3` NuGet package installed
- **Service**: `Services/S3Service.cs`
  - `UploadImageAsync(IFormFile file, string folder)` - Upload single image
  - `UploadMultipleImagesAsync(List<IFormFile> files, string folder)` - Upload multiple images
  - `DeleteImageAsync(string imageUrl)` - Delete image from S3
  - Auto-generates unique filenames with timestamps
  - Sets public-read ACL for uploaded images
  - Returns full S3 URLs

#### 2. Upload API Endpoints
- **Controller**: `Controllers/UploadController.cs`
  - `POST /api/upload/profile-image` - Upload single profile image (max 5MB)
  - `POST /api/upload/listing-images` - Upload multiple listing images (max 10 images)
  - `DELETE /api/upload/image` - Delete image from S3
  - Validates file types (JPG, PNG, WebP)
  - Validates file sizes and count

#### 3. Database Support
- **User Model**: Already has `ProfileImageUrl` field
- **UpdateProfileDto**: Added `ProfileImageUrl` property
- **UsersController**: Updated `PUT /users/{id}` to accept `ProfileImageUrl`

#### 4. Configuration
- **appsettings.json**: AWS section added with credentials
- **Program.cs**: AWS S3 client registered with DI
- **Console Output**: Shows "‚úì AWS S3 configured" on startup

### Frontend (Complete)

#### 1. Single Image Upload Component
- **File**: `components/ImageUpload.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Image preview with drag-and-drop support
  - Upload progress indicator
  - Remove/replace image functionality
  - Validates file type and size (5MB max)
  - Calls `POST /api/upload/profile-image`
  - Used for profile pictures

#### 2. Multiple Image Upload Component
- **File**: `components/MultipleImageUpload.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Grid display with drag-and-drop
  - Upload up to 10 images
  - First image marked as "Main Image"
  - Individual image removal
  - Upload progress for each image
  - Validates file types and total count
  - Calls `POST /api/upload/listing-images`
  - Used for listing images

#### 3. Profile Page Integration
- **File**: `app/account/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Imported `ImageUpload` component
  - Added `profileImageUrl` state
  - Integrated `ImageUpload` at top of form
  - Sends `profileImageUrl` to backend on save
  - Displays current profile image if exists

#### 4. Create Listing Page Integration
- **File**: `app/sell/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Imported `MultipleImageUpload` component
  - Added `imageUrls` state array
  - Replaced placeholder with functional upload component
  - Sends `imageUrls` array to backend on listing creation
  - Removed "coming soon" placeholder

#### 5. API Updates
- **File**: `lib/api.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `updateProfile()` to accept `profileImageUrl` parameter
  - Listings already supported `imageUrls` array

#### 6. Translations
- **File**: `contexts/LanguageContext.tsx`
- **Added Keys**:
  - `profileImage` - "Pr√≥f√≠lmynd" / "Profile Image"
  - `imagesHelp` - Help text for image upload (Icelandic + English)

## üîß Configuration Required

### AWS S3 Setup (User Completed)
According to conversation, the user has:
1. ‚úÖ Created IAM user "kaup-s3-uploader"
2. ‚úÖ Generated access keys
3. ‚úÖ Added credentials to `appsettings.Development.json`

**AWS Configuration in appsettings.json:**
```json
{
  "AWS": {
    "AccessKey": "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID",
    "SecretKey": "YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY",
    "Region": "eu-west-1",
    "BucketName": "kaup-images"
  }
}
```

### Remaining AWS Setup
Still need to:
1. Create S3 bucket `kaup-images` in `eu-west-1` region
2. Configure bucket for public read access
3. Create IAM policy with S3 upload permissions
4. Attach policy to `kaup-s3-uploader` user

**Note**: See `AWS_S3_SETUP.md` for detailed step-by-step instructions.

## üìù How It Works

### Profile Image Upload Flow
1. User navigates to `/account` page
2. Clicks on image upload area or drags image
3. Image preview shown immediately
4. On "Save Changes", image uploads to S3
5. S3 URL sent to backend with profile update
6. Backend saves URL to `User.ProfileImageUrl`
7. Image displays on user profile

### Listing Images Upload Flow
1. User navigates to `/sell` page
2. Clicks on upload area or drags multiple images
3. All images upload to S3 in parallel
4. Upload progress shown for each image
5. First image automatically marked as "Main Image"
6. On form submit, array of S3 URLs sent to backend
7. Backend saves URLs to `Listing.ImageUrls` (JSON array)

## üß™ Testing

### Test Profile Image Upload
1. Start backend: `cd backend/Kaup.Api && dotnet run`
2. Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Login to account
4. Navigate to `/account`
5. Upload a profile image
6. Click "Save Changes"
7. Check that image appears in profile

### Test Listing Images Upload
1. Navigate to `/sell`
2. Fill out listing form
3. Upload 1-10 images
4. First image should show "Main Image" badge
5. Submit form
6. Navigate to created listing
7. Images should display (once listing detail page is updated)

## üîÑ Next Steps

### Still TODO:
1. **Display uploaded images on listing detail page**
   - Currently listing detail page doesn't display the uploaded images
   - Need to add image carousel/gallery to `app/listings/[id]/page.tsx`

2. **Display profile image throughout app**
   - Show profile image in header when logged in
   - Show profile image on profile page
   - Show seller profile image on listings

3. **Image optimization**
   - Consider adding image resizing on upload
   - Generate thumbnails for faster loading
   - Add WebP conversion for better compression

4. **Error handling**
   - Add better error messages for upload failures
   - Handle S3 service errors gracefully
   - Add retry logic for failed uploads

5. **Security**
   - Add authentication to upload endpoints
   - Validate that user can only upload to their own profile
   - Add virus scanning for uploaded files
